          p I thought what I'd do was, I'd pretend I was one of those deaf-mutes. That way I wouldn't have to have any goddam stupid useless conversation with anybody. If anybody wanted to tell me something,
            they'd have to write it on a piece of paper and shove it over to me. They'd get bored as hell doing
            that after a while, and then I'd be through with having conversations for the rest of my life.
